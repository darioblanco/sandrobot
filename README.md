The idea comes from here
http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/2830035130/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-in-python

Why? http://thesoftjaguar.com/blog/post10/ (sorry, it is in spanish).

Any feedback about the code can be directed to my email address: dblancoit@gmail.com

The bot sentences are in spanish, sorry about that but it was a spanish bot. I have set it up quickly for a friend and I thought that it could be interesting to put it on github for everyone.
